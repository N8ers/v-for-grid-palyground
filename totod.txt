vue-custom-grid-generator (v-for-grid-generator)
mission statement: allow for easy control custom grids, on iterated components
- customize stragglers (left align, right align, center)
- max-width (when does the grid stop populating & what does it do in that space? align center, stick left, stick right?)
- custom break points (when to start new line)
- alow grid flexing inbetween break points (grid shrink to certain % width)
